# Module based on lambdas

Lambdas in Ruby (or procs if you will, the difference is not important in the
present context) are powerful abstractions that make it possible to write
functional Ruby code in general and higher-order functions in particular.

The present example demonstrates a module written using [nothing but
lambdas](calc.rb), where its entry point itself is a lambda. Note how the
implementation does not define any methods and the actual lambdas doing the
calculations are stored in variables accessible *only* to the entry-point lambda,
in effect creating a [closure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)).

The [application](app.rb) in turn uses the imported object as a callable.

This example also demonstrates the power of `export_default`, which can be used
to hide a ton of complexity behind *any* Ruby object.
